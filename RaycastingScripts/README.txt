# How to make a raycasting gun

1. Open explorer in Roblox Studio.
2. Insert a tool into the workspace and name that tool whatever.
3. Insert a local script and a script inside your tool.
4. Name the local script "GunScript".
5. Name the script "WeldScript".
6. Copy the code from "GunScript.lua" into "Gunscript".
7. Copy the code from "qPerfectionWeld.lua" into "WeldScript".
8. Insert 2 parts into the workspace.
9. Name the handle "Handle", and name the barrel "Barrel".
10. Now in the explorer, drag both of those parts into your Gu tool.

Now you're done with the basics!

If you add more parts to your model, be sure to drag them into your gun tool in the explorer.
